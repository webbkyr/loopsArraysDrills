//Hey Kayla great job wrapping up the hazard alert exercise.  I'm having trouble with
//my connection to Slack for some reason that's been going on for about an hour now
//so I haven't been able to message you there.  I'm going to take a shot at the forEach, 
//filter, and map exercise and then I'm going to look over everything we did today wtih my Mentor.
//Hope you have a good night and see you back in class tomorrow!
